# Supabase Configuration

# Option 1 (RECOMMENDED): Use anon key with Row Level Security
# This is the public key - safe to use, relies on RLS for security
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key

# Option 2: Use service role key (admin access - bypasses RLS)
# Only use if you need admin operations or don't have RLS enabled
# NEVER commit this key - keep it secret!
# SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key

# Note: The server will use SUPABASE_ANON_KEY if available,
# otherwise falls back to SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
